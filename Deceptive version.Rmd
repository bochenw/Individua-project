#Individual Project – Deceptive Version

## 1.	American’s Gun related Homicides rates is well below the world’s average.

The purpose of this graph is to prove that the US is an outlier on gun violence because it has way more guns than other developed nations. The author compared the United States with other countries about homicide by firearms per 1 million people, and the result shows that the United States has way more murders by firearms than other countries.

However, the author only picked couple countries with low homicide by firearms per 1 million people rate, and this action intentionally made the US prominent. After I include other nations in the analysis, the following graph tells me another story.

This chart represents the homicide by firearm per 1 million people for different countries all over the world. When the rate goes higher, the country color becomes redder. From this chart, we can easily observe that most countries stay in the “yellow” realm, the most dangerous areas are Middle American, South American, Mexico and South Africa. 

According to UNODC, Small Arms Survey, via The Guardian. America has 4.4 percent of the world’s population and almost half of the civilian-owned guns around the world. With this massive number of firearms owned by the citizen, US still keep their homicide by firearm per 1 million people rate in a relatively low range, well below the world’s average.

## 2.	More Guns does NOT lead to More homicide.

The purpose of the original graph is to prove that more guns lead to more gun-related death. The author compared the United States with other countries, and the result shows that the United States has way higher numbers on both X-axis and Y-axis. The trending line looks convincing and its natural for the reader to conclude that more guns lead to more gun-related death. However, the author intentionally picked couple countries, after I include all the nations, the conclusion has changed.

From the graph above, we can observe that although the US has the highest rate for guns owned per 100 people, it’s gun-related death rate per 100,000 people is very low. I also added a trending line to the graph, and we can see that the slope of the line is negative, it means more guns owned by people can decrease the firearm-related deaths. 

It’s simple to understand, the purpose of people having guns is not trying to hurt others, this is an effective way to protect themselves from bad people. People looking for tools to protect themselves of all time, and the gun is a powerful tool for people to defend themselves from others. From the evidence provided by the graph, the conclusion is more guns owned by people does not lead to more gun-related deaths.

## 3. Tighter gun control laws DOES NOT lead to fewer gun related deaths
The author used gun ownership rate by state as an indicator of the gun law strength for that state; the more restrict the law is, the fewer people own guns in that state.  The original graph shows the relationship between Gun Ownership Vs. Gun Deaths.

Use gun ownership as an indicator of the gun law strength at that state sounds convincing: the more restrict the law is, the fewer people own guns in that state. I found data and ranking numbers generated by Gifford’s Law Center, aggregate this dataset with previous gun deaths dataset and include this factor in analysis instead of gun ownership percentage. The following graph surprisingly shows that gun laws strength is unrelated to gun-related deaths.

From the above graph, I put state name on X-axis, and sorted state from left to right based on gun laws strength from A to F. The gun laws strength measured by six aspects: Background Checks, Child Access Prevention, Concealed Carry Permitting, Domestic Violence, Extreme Risk Protection Order and Military-style Weaponry. If tighter gun laws control leads to fewer gun-related deaths, we can have expected that plots on the graph will have an increasing trend. However, from the figure above, we cannot observe any pattern. Also, different dots from the same state represent the deaths number from 2014 - 2017, we can find that although some state like California or Illinois has very restrictive gun control laws, their gun deaths number does not have a decreasing trend and still changing in a broad range. According to above analysis, we can conclude that state gun control strength is unrelated to gun related deaths at that state, the government should focus on other possible reasons, like education level, poverty rate, unemployment rate, etc.
