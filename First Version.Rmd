# First Redesign of Gun Violence

## 1. Mass shooting statistics with US States gun laws map.

The original graph described that there had been more than 1,600 mass shootings since Sandy Hook. From the Article, the author mentioned that economist Richard Florida took a look at gun deaths and other social indicators, and he found that higher populations, more stress, more immigrants, and more mental illness didn’t correlate with more gun deaths. However, he didn’t include those indicators in the graph, and there’s no way to prove it.

The original graph only shows the mass shooting happened after Sandy Hook; I used the data from Gun Violence Archive that including all the mass shooting occurred in the United States from 2014 – 2018. I added time series factor into the graph trying to prove that mass shooting does not happen just at one time, it is highly correlated with the geographic factor, and I also added US States population statistics into to the map. From the final graph, I can interpret that state population has correlation with mass shooting incidents.

I redesigned the graph, kept all other states plain and only highlight the states that have at least one-gun control laws. In this way, the reader can compare this graph with the previous graph. Finally, I used line plot and added trend line among those states; it shows that for those states that have at least one gun control law, most states have a decreasing trend for mass shooting incidents. It indicates that gun-control laws have a positive impact to decrease mass shooting incidents, but not significantly.

## 2. Compared with other developed countries, The United States has the highest homicides by firearm rate per 1 million people

The purpose of this graph is to prove that the US is an outlier on gun violence because it has way more guns than other developed nations. The author compared the United States with other developed countries about homicide by firearms per 1 million people, and the result surprising shows that the United States has way higher homicide by firearms than other countries. 

The original graph looks pretty and used different numbers of people’s figure to illustrate the difference between the United States and other developed countries. The reason for me to redesign this graph is because the original diagram is very long vertically, and I have to scroll up and down several times to view the whole image and to build a complete understanding of all the information included in the graph.

I redesign the figure, used packed bubbles tool to reach the goal. The size of the bubbles indicates the homicide by firearms per 1 million people, the bigger the bubble, the higher the rate. From the new graph, readers will have an apparent understanding of all the information included in the graph, and the bubble size of United States is significantly larger than other countries. It is consistent with the author’s primary purpose that he was trying to prove that the US is an outlier on gun violence because it has way more guns than other developed nations.

## 3.Gun Death Rate Vs. Gun Law Strength

Gun Ownership rate by state is a good indicator of the gun law strength for that state; the more restrict the law is, the fewer people own guns in that state. The first image is the original graph used in the article that shows the relationship between Gun Ownership Vs. Gun Deaths.  I searched online and found the data generated by Gifford’s Law Center that including gun law strength, gun death rate, gun death ranking, etc. for all 50 U.S. States.  

I used those data and redesigned the original graph in a better way to prove that gun-related death rate is highly correlated with local state gun control laws, and if the local government want to decrease the gun-related death rate, enforce gun control laws is an effective way to reach the goal.

The gun laws strength measured by six aspects: Background Checks, Child Access Prevention, Concealed Carry Permitting, Domestic Violence, Extreme Risk Protection Order and Military-style Weaponry. For example, Massachusetts ranked the 4th among 50 states that have the most restrictive gun laws, and it has the lowest gun death rate.

I put Gun Death Rate on X-axis and Gun Law Strength Ranking on Y-axis, different color in the plot shows the detailed about the laws strength grades rated by Gifford’s Law Center. From the new graph, the reader can easily observe that when specific State has weak gun law strength, it often results in higher gun death rate. I can easily interpret from the graph that if the local government wants to decrease the gun-related death rate, enforce gun control laws is an effective way to reach the goal.

The data and ranking number are generated by Gifford’s Law Center; an organization dedicates to prevent gun violence. Source: http://lawcenter.giffords.org/scorecard/#CA
